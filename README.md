# JavaScript Fromeworks Assignment 1

A portfolio website built using Node.js, the express generator, and pug templating engine.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
* [Express-Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) - Application generator
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - Templating engine

## Note

I built a portfolio website before and I'm merging it into this project so it runs off node instead of PHP.
A live version of my OLD portfolio can be viewed [here](https://portfolio.deadfyre.com/).
Once this project is complete it'll replace my old portfolio and be hosted on the same domain.

The 3rd party libraries/frameworks that are being used and will eventually be implemented to this project are as follows
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JavaScript library
* [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) - Library to help manage poppers
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end styling library
* [Typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) - Library that gives text a typing effect
* [baguetteBox.js](https://feimosi.github.io/baguetteBox.js/) - A lightbox script
* [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) - Library to create particles
* [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) - Handles copying text to clipboard
