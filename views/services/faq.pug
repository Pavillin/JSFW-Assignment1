          b What is the whole process?
        p
          | First, you submit a form detailing what you want created and what your vision is. Next I'll contact you and tell you how much it'll cost. Once I recieve payment I begin working on your project, once I have a polished product you'll see it. After that you either accept what I made and I will send you all the files, or I will make changes you want to the project. This will repeat until you're happy and accept the project.
